 * A tree can be uniquely identified by any one of the following sequence
 * - InOrder and PreOrder
 * - InOrder and PostOrder
 * - InOrder and LevelOrder
 *
 * Solution:
 * condition1: T2 InOrder seq present in T1 InOrder seq
 * Condition2: T2 PostOrder seq present in T1 PostOrder seq
 *  T2 is T1 subtree if condition1 and condition2 are true.
